# Code-Quiz

The goal of this challenge/project was to create a coding quiz. 

1. The point of this assignment was to create a quiz with coding questions with a timer, and a list of highscores at the end. 

2. The player will see whether they got the answer correct or incorrect at the bottom as soon as they click their answer. 

3. When you click on 'Start Quiz' the timer starts to go down. Any time the player clicks the wrong answer, there is a 10 second penalty. 

4. At the end, the player can view highscores from highest to the lowest score. They have the option to clear the highscore.
